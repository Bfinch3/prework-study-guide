<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<ul>
<li>A variable (var) is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
<li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
<li>Use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
<li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code.</li>
<li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
<li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
<li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
<li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
<li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>
<li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is ran.</li>
